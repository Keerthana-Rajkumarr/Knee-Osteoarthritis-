# Knee Osteoarthritis Detection Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

# Knee Osteoarthritis
  # Normal:
  Inside a healthy knee, everything looks smooth and white.
  The joint is like a well-lubricated hinge with no visible problems.
   
  # Osteoarthritis:
  In an osteoarthritis knee, the smooth white covering might wear away or get thinner.
  The space inside the joint may decrease, and little bony bumps could appear.
  Sometimes, there might be swelling, especially in later stages
